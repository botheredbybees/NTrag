Some notes on data conversion

I messed around a bit with the original .docx file to get it into the final JavaScript array used by the app.

Although I didn't take notes at the time, here's my best recollection of the process:

Opened the doc in Word for Windows, saved as an html file
Converted the <= windows special character to a regular <=
Maybe converted CR LF to <br> (can't be sure about this, memory is hazy)
Selected the table and copied it to the clipboard
Started Open Office and pasted into a new spreadsheet
Removed all HTML formatting
Exported as csv with the 'surround all fields with quotes' setting on
Opened the csv file in a text editor and did some search and replacing to make each line into an array 
Wrapped the lines in another array
Done
